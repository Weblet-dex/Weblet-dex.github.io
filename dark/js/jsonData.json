<\/p><span class=\"bodycopy\">This <span class=\"bodycopy\"><span>scenario <\/span><\/span>is actually a common and intentional side-effect of the Crypto Collider system as a players profitability and strategy is not only determined by their wagers value and trajectory but also its coin type and game selection - i.e. choose the right coins to wager in the right games and it almost won't matter what percentage of loses you have as long as its not all of them. <p id=\"br\"> <\/p><p id=\"br\"> <\/p><span class=\"bodycopy\"><span>Essentially <\/span><\/span>to use Collider as a semi-random hedging service, players should wager many times in small units repeated steadily over time in the coin they wish to hedge out of - because when you are not in a rush its a wise strategy to spread your wagers over as many games as possible to even out the high variability of outcomes within individual games. <p id=\"br\"> <\/p><p id=\"br\"> <\/p>This is in contrast to the player who wants to use the Collider system as an alternative to dumping\/trading out of their coins who needs to do so in a much more immediate strategy - their results will be much less predictable although much more immediate (which could be preferable if the coin in question experiences a steep decline in the time it would take to make more wagers of smaller units over more games). <p id=\"br\">
